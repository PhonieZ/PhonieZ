Hello! I am and have been a hobbyist programmer	for several years, and the bulk of my 
programming knowledge is on the Python programming language.However, I have tried other 
languages, such as Lua and C#, but in comparison to my Python experience, my proficiency 
in these other programming languages is not so good.

Now, on this github profile, all I really do here is just publish projects I have worked 
on in my spare time. Yeah, that is it.
